# Self-Driving Car Project

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a self-driving car model using deep learning techniques. The main goal is to create a model that can successfully navigate a car through a simulated environment.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the model.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning frameworks used for building and training the neural network.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing.
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs and visualizing data.
- **Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator**: The environment used for testing the model.

## Project Structure
- `IMG/`: Contains images used in the project.
- `finding-lanes/`: Contains scripts for lane finding.
- `Deep_Neural.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for deep neural network implementation.
- `Multiclass.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for multiclass classification.
- `Perceptron.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for perceptron implementation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `driving_log.csv`: Log file for driving data.
- `test_image.jpg`: Sample test image.
